to me
Dear Matthew,
FYI.
Based on the second reviewer’s comment, it appears that the expectation is for the student to include some form ofoutput or result-based testing. If I’m not mistaken, I had previously mentioned the importance of includingnumerical results to support the findings as part of the evaluation process.
Therefore, you may advise your student to perform testing that leads toquantifiable outputs—such as performance metrics, accuracy rates, or other relevant numerical results—depending on the nature of the work.
Please let me know if you need further clarification.
Regards,
Usha

Dear Dr.Prabha,
We
have reviewed the feedback provided and would like to seek
clarification on the type of testing the student is required to perform.
This is because the second reviewer commented to consider
conducting testing, but it was not specified what type of testing
should be carried out.
Regards,
Usha
