## Publication

All papers will be published in a Special Volume of the esteemed AIP Conference
Proceedings, which is indexed in several leading databases such as Web of
Science and Scopus. However, how quickly selected proceedings are available in
an abstracting and indexing service is up to the provider; AIP Publishing has no
influence on this timeframe. Selected papers will be invited to be extended and
submitted to the following participating journals, provided that the extended
version contains at least 80% new content:
