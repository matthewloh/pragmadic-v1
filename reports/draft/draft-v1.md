Okay, acting as a publisher reviewing your final year project report for potential submission to the CITIC 2025 conference (focused on "Emerging Technologies for Sustainable Development" and published via AIP Conference Proceedings), here is a guiding prompt to help you transform your extensive report into a concise, impactful 6-page paper.

Publisher's Guidance Prompt for CITIC 2025 Paper (AIP Conference Proceedings):

Project Title: PRAGMADIC: PENANG-BASED DIGITAL NOMAD PLATFORM WITH RAG-INTEGRATED ANSWER ENGINE  

Author: Matthew Loh Yet Marn  

Conference: CITIC 2025 (Theme: Emerging Technologies for Sustainable Development)

Publication: AIP Conference Proceedings (Max 6 pages)  

Objective: Condense the comprehensive final year report  into a 6-page paper conforming to the AIP template  and CITIC 2025's theme, highlighting novel contributions in Computer Science, Information Technology, or Intelligent Computing for sustainable development.  

Key Strengths & Concepts Identified from the Report:

    Problem Definition: Clear identification of the fragmented information and onboarding challenges faced by digital nomads (DNs) in Malaysia, specifically within the DE Rantau program context, and the need for a centralized, intelligent platform. The focus on Penang is a good specific scope.   

Proposed Solution - PRAGMADIC: Development of a web platform integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide personalized, real-time information and onboarding support.  
Technical Architecture: A modern full-stack approach using Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI/Ollama, and Vercel AI SDK. The RAG architecture itself is a significant technical component.  
Key Features:

    RAG-Integrated Answer Engine for DE Rantau visa/program queries.   

Onboarding Support Module (Mapbox integration, event/hub Browse).  
Community/Networking features (Hubs, Events, Communities).  
AI-driven Analytics Module for Hub Owners (data visualization, LLM insights).  

Methodology: Prototyping model justified by the evolving nature of LLMs and requirements. Questionnaire analysis provided valuable user insights.  
Evaluation: Black box, integration, and security testing performed.  

Actionable Steps for Condensing into 6 Pages (AIP Format):

    Refocus the Narrative: Frame the entire paper around the conference theme: "Emerging Technologies for Sustainable Development." How does PRAGMADIC, using AI and modern web tech, contribute to sustainable development? (e.g., supporting the digital economy, facilitating skilled worker mobility, potentially reducing resource waste through better information access, fostering local economic integration ). This angle needs to be explicit, likely in the Introduction and Conclusion.   

Prioritize Core Contribution: The RAG-integrated Answer Engine and the AI-driven Analytics seem the most novel technical contributions relevant to CITIC tracks (AI/ML, Info Systems, Software Eng.). While the onboarding map and community features are essential to the platform, focus the limited space on the how and why of the AI/technical aspects.  
Structure according to AIP Template:

Title: Keep it concise and informative.   

Authors/Affiliation/Emails: Follow format precisely.  
Abstract (9pt font, 0.2" indent): Rewrite completely. Summarize the problem, the core RAG/AI solution (PRAGMADIC), key methodology/tech, primary results/evaluation, and its contribution to sustainable development within the word/space limit. This is crucial.  
Introduction (Merge Ch 1): Drastically condense. State the problem (DN information fragmentation ), introduce PRAGMADIC as the AI-driven solution, briefly mention the DE Rantau context, state the paper's core objective (presenting the RAG/AI system and its evaluation), and explicitly link it to the conference theme. (~0.5 - 0.75 page)  
Literature Review (Merge relevant parts of Ch 2): Highly selective. Focus only on directly relevant existing systems (maybe DE Rantau app, Citizen Remote briefly) to highlight gaps PRAGMADIC fills, and core concepts like RAG and the specific AI/web technologies you used (briefly justify choices like Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI ). Omit detailed comparisons of multiple frameworks/BaaS unless critical to justifying your specific choice. (~0.75 - 1 page)  
Methodology (Merge relevant parts of Ch 3): Briefly mention the Prototyping model. Focus on the architecture (Fig 2.29 RAG, Fig 2.30 Overall are key, simplify them for the paper), and key implementation details of the RAG and Analytics modules. Crucially, describe how data was sourced/processed for the RAG knowledge base. Omit detailed Gantt charts, Kanban boards, extensive questionnaire analysis (perhaps mention key findings briefly if space allows). ERD might be too detailed for 6 pages unless simplified to core entities. (~1.5 - 2 pages)  
Implementation/Results (Merge Ch 4 & 5): This is critical. Focus on showcasing the functionality and evaluation of the RAG Answer Engine and the AI Analytics. Use concise descriptions and key screenshots (like Fig 4.22, 4.61, 4.63 ). Summarize key Black Box and Integration testing results, perhaps in a small table or brief text. Mention security considerations (like RAG guardrails ) concisely. (~1.5 - 2 pages)  
Discussion (Merge Ch 6): Briefly discuss achievements (functional RAG/AI platform), limitations (e.g., scope, model constraints ), and link back to how the technology addresses the initial problem and contributes to sustainable development. (~0.25 page)  
Conclusion (Merge Ch 8): Summarize the paper's contribution (the PRAGMADIC system, focusing on its RAG/AI components), reiterate the link to sustainable development, and perhaps mention one key future direction. (~0.25 page)
Acknowledgments: Optional, keep very brief.  
References: Format strictly per AIP style. Include only cited works. Remove appendix references from main text. (~0.5 page)  
 
Visuals: Select only the most impactful figures (e.g., simplified architecture diagrams, key UI screenshots ). Ensure they are high resolution, fit within margins, and have captions formatted per AIP style. Combine multi-part figures (like (a), (b)) efficiently.  
Conciseness: Eliminate redundancy. Rephrase long sentences. Remove overly detailed explanations of standard technologies unless your use of them is novel. Focus on your specific implementation and findings. The original report's ~190 pages must be distilled significantly.
Adherence to AIP Style: Strictly follow font (Times New Roman, specified sizes), margin, heading, caption, and reference guidelines in the template. No headers/footers/page numbers. Ensure fonts are embedded in the final PDF.  

Timeline Reminder:

    Current Date: April 19th, 2025
    Plagiarism Check: April 24th, 2025
    Submission Deadline: April 30th, 2025

This is a tight schedule. Focus intensely on restructuring, condensing content based on the priorities above, and strictly adhering to the 6-page AIP format. Good luck!
